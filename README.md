The "Online Orders Analysis Using Python and SQL" project aims to derive valuable insights from online order data to support business decision-making.
By integrating Python for data analysis and visualization with a SQL database for data storage and querying, the project leverages the strengths of both technologies. 
Key objectives include connecting to a SQL database to retrieve data, cleaning the data to handle missing values and duplicates, transforming the data for analysis, and conducting various analyses to uncover trends and patterns.
Visual representations of the results are created using Python's visualization libraries, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Technologies used in this project include Python (with Pandas and NumPy), SQL, 
Jupyter Notebook, and data visualization libraries.
